# Test for Analytics

Design tests for Analytics functionality on a Battery Monitoring System.

Fill the parts marked '_enter' in the **Tasks** section below.

## Analysis-functionality to be tested

This section lists the Analysis for which _tests_ must be written.

Battery Telemetrics are collected and stored on a server.
Data for a month is stored in a [csv file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

Analysis must be done on this csv file to find the following:
- minimum
- maximum
- count of breaches (how many times did it cross the threshold in a month?)
- record trends (date & time when the reading was continuously increasing for 30 minutes)

A PDF report of the analysis must be stored every week.
Notification must be sent when a new report is available.

## Tasks

### List Dependencies

List the dependencies of the Analysis-functionality.

1. Access to the Server containing the telemetrics in a csv file
1. Library to read CSV, Generate PDF, File operations, send notification
1. Access to Email Server


### Mark the System Boundary

What is included in the software unit-test? What is not? Fill this table.

| Item                      | Included?     | Reasoning / Assumption
|---------------------------|---------------|---
Battery Data-accuracy       | No            | We do not test the accuracy of data
Computation of maximum      | Yes           | This is part of the software being developed
Off-the-shelf PDF converter | Yes           | Need to test report to PDF conversion
Counting the breaches       | Yes           | Counting breaches is part of developement
Detecting trends            | Yes           | Detecting trend is part of developement
Notification utility        | NO            | Utility methods are not developed by us

### List the Test Cases

Write tests in the form of `<expected output or action>` from `<input>` / when `<event>`

Add to these tests:

1. Write minimum and maximum to the PDF from a csv containing positive and negative readings
1. Write "Invalid input" to the PDF when the csv doesn't contain expected data
1. Write Number of breaches to the PDF if csv has any
1. Write trend information to the PDF if csv has any
2. Write email receiver information to the PDF


### Recognize Fakes and Reality

Consider the tests for each functionality below.
In those tests, identify inputs and outputs.
Enter one part that's real and another part that's faked/mocked.

| Functionality            | Input        | Output                      | Faked/mocked part
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|---
Read input from server     | csv file     | internal data-structure     | Fake the server store
Validate input             | csv data     | valid / invalid             | None - it's a pure function
Notify report availability | PDF report   | Notify the respective       | Mock the notify utility 
Report inaccessible server | Server name  | Connection Status           | Fake the server store
Find minimum and maximum   | csv data     | maximum and minimum         | None - it's a pure function
Detect trend               | csv data     | find treand in data         | None - it's a pure function
Write to PDF               | formated file| PDF with file data          | Mock the PDF utility
